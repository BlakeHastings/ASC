# ASC
This project is an emulator and (when implemented in the future) assembler of ASC assembly language from Computer Organization, Design, and Architecture 4th Edition.

# Dev Environment

You will need this extension to work with the front end of the application:

Other than that, just clone the project and open it with Visual Studio.
